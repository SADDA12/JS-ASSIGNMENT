Functions:
1. Function Declaration: Create a function named calculateArea that takes the radius of a circle as a parameter and returns the area.
2. Function Expression: Define a function expression named multiply that multiplies two numbers.
3. Default Parameters: Write a function greet that takes a name as a parameter and defaults to "Guest" if no name is provided.
4. Arrow Functions: Convert the following function declaration to an arrow function:
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}
Objects:
5. Object Creation: Create an object car with properties for make, model, and year.
6. Object Method: Add a method start to the car object that logs "Engine started!" to the console.
7. Object Iteration: Write a function printObject that accepts an object as a parameter and prints each key-value pair.
8. Object Destructuring: Extract the make and model properties from the car object using destructuring.
Arrays:
9. Array Creation: Create an array named fruits with at least three fruit names.
10. Array Methods: Use the array fruits to add a new fruit at the end and remove the first fruit.
11. Array Iteration: Write a function printFruits that accepts an array of fruits and prints each fruit to the console.
12. Given an array of ints, return true if 6 appears as either the first or last element in the array. The array will be length 1 or more.
Examples `

firstLast6([1, 2, 6]) → true
firstLast6([6, 1, 2, 3]) → true
firstLast6([13, 6, 1, 2, 3]) → false.`
// complete the function below

function firstLast6(nums){
  
}
Loops:
13. For Loop: Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
14. While Loop: Use a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 8.
15. Nested Loop: Create a nested loop to print a multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5.
Conditional Statements:
16. If Statement: Write an if statement to check if a variable temperature is greater than 30 and log "It's hot!" if true.
17. Switch Statement: Implement a switch statement for the variable dayOfWeek to log different messages for each day.
18. Ternary Operator: Use a ternary operator to determine if a number is even or odd and log the result.
19. Truthy/Falsy Values: Explain the concept of truthy and falsy values in JavaScript with an example.
20. Logical Operators: Combine two conditions using logical operators to check if a number is both greater than 10 and less than 20.
